 My Recipie is of a Chocolate Icecream 

1.Whip the cream till it is fluffy
2.Add Nestl√© MILKMAID, chocolate sauce, vanilla essence & mix well
3.Pour into a freezing tray and freeze till half set. Remove and beat with a whisk or electric beater until smooth. Doing so will help keep the texture of the ice cream soft and creamy while it sets
4.Pour back into tray and freeze till well set
